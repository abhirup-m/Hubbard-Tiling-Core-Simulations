# Hubbard Tiling Core Simulations

Minimal, self-contained computer programs for simulations and computations on the extended Hubbard model tiling project

## How to read this
- Phase diagram calculation
- Impurity model $k-$space static correlation calculation (spin, charge)
- Impurity model local spectral function and quasiparticle residue
- Impurity model local self-energy and optical conductivity
- Tiled real-space static correlation calculation (spin, entanglement measures, QFI)
- Tiled $k-$space spectral function and self-energy
